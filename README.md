***Pomegranate - Women's Health App***

Women are rarely first-in-mind when developing fitness, diet, and health applications. Additionally, information regarding women’s health is not always accessible or easy to understand.   

For HackCWRU 2026, our group developed a web app for personalized women's healthcare. Women can track their menstrual cycle, maintain a journal for their mental health, get customized recipes and exercises based on their body type and cycle, ask questions to an AI-chat assistant surrounding women’s health topics, and find resources in their area.
